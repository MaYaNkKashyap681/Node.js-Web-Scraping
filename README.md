# Web Scraping with Node.js and Puppeteer

This project explores various web scraping techniques using Node.js and Puppeteer, a headless Chrome browser automation tool. Web scraping allows you to extract data from websites, which can be useful for a wide range of applications, from data analysis to creating custom datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scraping-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd web-scraping-project
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

The project is organized into different folders, each containing a specific web scraping technique or use case. Explore each folder for detailed examples and code snippets related to that technique.

To run a specific scraping script, navigate to the relevant folder and execute the script using Node.js. For example:

```bash
cd basic-scraping
node scrape.js
```

### Techniques Explored

- **Basic Web Scraping**: Introduction to Puppeteer, navigating to a web page, and extracting data.

- **Paginated Scraping**: Scraping data from paginated websites with multiple pages.
